# Project- Intro to Data Analytics
I led a team of 5 members and collaborated with the analytics team of myAgro, a non-profit organization supporting small farmers in West Africa.
The team performed data cleaning, exploration, and visualization using Python libraries and	Investigated sales patterns across 3 years and presented actionable insights and recommendations to the company. We were selected as the top 2 teams to present the findings to the entire analytics team of the company across globe.
